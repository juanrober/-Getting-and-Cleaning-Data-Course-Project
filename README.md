# -Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

I uploaded a file with the script.

Note that my language is spanish, so you may find the script confusing, my apologies. 

This repo contains these files:

+ codebook.md - Description of the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
+ final_tidy_data.txt - The final tidy summary dataset. Presents the mean of each measurement variable for each subject and activity combination.
+ script.R - The script that I used to perform the required tasks.
